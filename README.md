The encrypt.py script works on windows.The script selects directories (Desktop, Documents,Downloads) where files are encrypted. And decrypt.py script decrypts files from these directories.
(bomb.py)This script creates ZIP bomb archives, which are compressed files designed to consume large amounts of resources when decompressed.The script takes input parameters such as the desired mode, 
decompression size, output ZIP file path, directories to include, and files to include. It then generates the ZIP bomb archive accordingly, measuring the compressed file size, size after decompression, 
and generation time.(unzip.py) This script extracts the contents of a ZIP archive into a hidden folder.
(off.py)This script disables all peripheral devices connected to the system on Windows. It utilizes the win32api, win32con, win32gui, and win32com.client modules to interact with system devices.
It first retrieves a list of all devices using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). Then, it defines a function to disable a specific device based on its InstanceID. Finally, it iterates through the list of devices, excluding system devices,
and disables each one using the defined function. After all peripheral devices are disabled, it prints a confirmation message.
